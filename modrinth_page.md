## A high performance packet-based damage indicator

</p>

DamageIndicator is an extensive and feature-rich healthbar manager for Minecraft servers.
It provides a system to **display damage dealt** to enemies solely using **packets**,
which means no actual armor stand entities will be spawned.

DamageIndicator is also **completely server-side** so **no additional mods are required** by your players.
The **high-performance** packet spawning and **flexible configuration** makes DamageIndicator extremely suitable for large PvP or Survival servers.
